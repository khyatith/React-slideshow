# React-slideshow

This is an About Us page done using React + Redux for fabfitfun.com screening test. I have used create-react-app.

I have used React Transition Group for doing some animations. However, it is not completely foolproof. I want to improve this by finding a different method to do transitions in React but due to time constraints , I am going with this one for now.

To run the project:

1. Clone the repo

2. cd about-us-app

3. Yarn start
